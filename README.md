# We are digital - CSS frontend challenge

## CSS FLEX BOXES

## My Approach:
- I went along implementing simple CSS using flex and media query.

- Media query just blow me up! It was interesting to implement and learn about the px size.

- I have used bootstrap in my previous project. But, I haven't tried using the media query. I did my best to exhibit CSS style as it looks like in the instruction.

- The CSS challenge was fun and interesting learning curve.

- I used [Bem](http://getbem.com/) for the naming convention and reliability.

- The boxes are responsive in which when the screen touch 768px the rows contain one box, when the screen is between 768px to 1024px will display the rows contains two boxes and above 1024px will display default boxes in rows of four.

## How to run the code:

- Unzip the file and run this command `open box.html` in the terminal to open the browser.

## Unfinished Business:
- Use SASS/SCSS.
- Maybe use Library like Material UI.

## My learning and source:
- [Media Query!](https://responsivedesign.is/develop/browser-feature-support/media-queries-for-common-device-breakpoints/)
- [Cheetsheet for CSS](https://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/#display)

Thanks for giving me this opportunity to learn more about flex and media query. I read somewhere that continually building things is how a programmer gets better and I can't wait to get stuck into the unFUNished business section of this write-up! I do hope that I hear from you guys soon.

Cheers,
